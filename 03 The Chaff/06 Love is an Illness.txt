Love is an Illness
==================

12/25/2014

Love is an illness for which there is no cure
A strain for every person
How many times can you survive the infection?
I hope I am highly contagious

Love is a prism for people
Who enter simple, relatively
Love cuts us up into faceted gems
I hope I am deftly refractive

Love is a hurricane that only ever before we're ready
Lifts us high above the world
Deepens us with vast perspective
Then gently sets us on our feet weeping from awe and with clarity

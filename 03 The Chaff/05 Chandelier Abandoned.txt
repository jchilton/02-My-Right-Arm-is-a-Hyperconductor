Chandelier Abandoned
====================

12/18/2014

A chandelier exists abandoned
By the sleeping, traipsing, galavanting,
Morning-drunk and morning-stoned

An elevator to success
Still operates from one to ten
And no-one uses it

Everything you need, for free,
To live in paradise is kind
Except for the snoring drunkard on the floor,
On his back,
Arms and legs spread out like a starfish

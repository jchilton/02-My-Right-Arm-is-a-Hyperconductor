The Pen: Mightier than the "S"-Word
===================================

What if I only ever wanted  
To study you, to know you,  

To be inside your mind?  
What if I never wanted to touch you?  

What if I understood everything about you from the moment we were introduced,  
And a more innocent and caring love is impossible?  

I assert without expectation that the preceding  
Is true in an unending and absolute sense.

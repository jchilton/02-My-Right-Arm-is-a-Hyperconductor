Beer, whose name I've forgotten:
You taste alright.

As I drink I leave rings of
foam around this glass, which
remind me of strata fro
Geology class at University.

Our struggle begins, as I
use you responsibly and you
drain my debit account in
exchange for inspiration and
recognition of the Social-Scientific Method.

This May Never See the Light of Day

Whiskey & tonic & bitters:

In order to justify my next action,
I am writing my intent. Your taste
is too sophisticated for me at the
age of 25, but I would not
insult the barman by bringing you
back unfinished. So I am going
to down you, then I am going
to ask for two glasses of water,
and I am going to go get my ‡•ê
tools when I finish the water, and
plant at the 24-hour coffee shop and
cure cancer.

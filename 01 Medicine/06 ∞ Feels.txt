When you'd won the game of speed,
I felt, Maggie, as if I'd explode.
I needed more of you not before
water and vomiting.
And you asked for your cards back
and I was left holding the Jack of Hearts.

How I wish that I'd successfully jacked
your heart that night.

But I am not a surgeon-thief.

the most painful partof life
is falling in love so many times
and letting go.

I did make it to the seat by the window
And *I know* why you couldn't sit calmly
where you were
at the table
holding the center with me

And your bus left for Milwaukee and I let you go
And by that time I'd already experienced
enough feeling
for all the lives that have ever been lived so far.

So when I got on my bus to Tomah, WI
(en-route to Boston)
I died again when I saw you there.

And now I am lucky and can honestly say
that regardless of anything I find on my way
to destinations both known and unknown

I will never experience pain, warmth or cold
because my reality is that you and I have
already exchanged enough of our souls
that if I never see you again and
you never see me
and we never communicated again in any capacity
I am whole now, just for those few hours we shared.

And although the hospital staff in Tomah, WI
tried to discharge me without treating me, and
due to inadequate education called the police, I
managed to receive the treatment I deserved
which was a tablet of anti-nausea medicine
tiny, effective and indigo-hued not visually
but in my mind's eye this medicine created
the loveliest hue of indigo
And so I was saved from the yellow caffeine
and the poison green of your hair.
And here I was thinking I loved you
when really you were just working for me as
medical staff to get me the medicine that I needed.

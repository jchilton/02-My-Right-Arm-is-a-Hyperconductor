When you'd won the game of speed,
I felt, Maggie, as if I'd explode.
I needed more of you not before
water and vomiting.
And you asked for your cards back
and I was left holding the Jack of Hearts.

How I wish that I'd successfully jacked
your heart that night.

But I am not a surgeon-thief.

the most painful partof life
is falling in love so many times
and letting go.

I did make it to the seat by the window
And *I know* why you couldn't sit calmly
where you were
at the table
holding the center with me

And your bus left for Milwaukee and I let you go
And by that time I'd already experienced
enough feeling
for all the lives that have ever been lived so far.

So when I got on my bus to Tomah, WI
(en-route to Boston)
I died again when I saw you there.

And now I am lucky and can honestly say
that regardless of anything I find on my way
to destinations both known and unknown

I will never experience pain, warmth or cold
because my reality is that you and I have
already exchanged enough of our souls
that if I never see you again and
you never see me
and we never communicated again in any capacity
I am whole now, just for those few hours we shared.

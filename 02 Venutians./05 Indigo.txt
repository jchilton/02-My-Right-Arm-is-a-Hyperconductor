What were we (not) going to fight about?
Weren't we going to fight because you wouldn't punch me in the face?
I wanted you to punch me because pain is how you know you're alive. I don't remember what you said in reply
because I was too busy remembering how you tapped the bus seat two times with your left hand, fingertips, beckoning (begging) me to be next to you.
And all the sex jokes you made about "man you're prepared... at least with the maps"
and I know from experience that when you said you wanted a crotch rocket you weren't talking about a motorcycle.
Ours was a perfect 6-hour marriage
Just too bad there were no rings involved
Except for while I waited for 9-1-1 to pick up
And you said you only talk about your writing with family
But you discussed it (your writing) pretty readily with me so does that make me family?
Maggie do you want to be married to me?
I've only been arrested once and the charges were dropped
and I promised someone I wouldn't return to WA state and there might be a warrant for my arrest in MT but we can live anywhere else
At least I became a grown up without having kids first
So that's something.
I have to stop writing right now or else I'd write to you forever
Just one last thing I don't think our religious conceptualizations of forever are compatible but idc

72X Southbound Tragedy
======================

11/6/2014

Warmth in the heart of a blizzard
A bomb explodes in the sky and releases a thousand crows from the void
A jillion seagulls fight back,
Defending the purity of the ocean from those black, winged agents of
Shiva the Destroyer
A trillion apologies addressed to you are not enough to lift the heavy
  crown from your tired head;
Nor said by me to earn the crown I've worn since childhood
So on and on against the current, kshatriya become brahmin.

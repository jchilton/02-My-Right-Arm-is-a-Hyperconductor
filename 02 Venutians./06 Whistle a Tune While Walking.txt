Whistle a Tune While Walking
============================

12/16/2014

Hey, pretty ladies!
I finally want some of you less
Than some of you want me

I like the feeling of your gaze
Crashing across my face after
You've turned to check me out
and I look straight ahead

Just know, beauty, that I see you
In my peripheral vision
Your darling does not go unnoticed
